Demonstrate how you will make them more money, like highlighting their most profitable items, or providing a design that is unique to their market. Scan code sign up? Selling advertising? Interactive features?

## What to pitch

### Restaurant Owners:

"My app can design a menu for you (automatically, for free) that will increase sales by 50% per month."

"Our platform can offer you automated customer call handling, online marketing, host your menu website, take orders online/phone, offer targeted discounts, create/design QR menu plackards all in one place."

"Get better search ranking and 10% more online sales when using our online menu."

"We will even create food images for you based on food selfies."

### To Business Partners:

"We can collect customer, restaurant, economic, tax, information and use that to offer more API services and grow the company."

"An all in one platform allows us to offer services or products (gift-cards) which we can collect a % of each sale and boosts restaurant sales."

"Having access to more data can allow us to provide restaurant owners with better tools (insights) for growing their business (demographic, sales, etc via AI). An owner could find the most profitable day to serve their signature dish based on historical sales data or a customer could know the most popular dish."
